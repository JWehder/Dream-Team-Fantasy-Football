# Phase-2 Project: Dream Team Fantasy Football

Dream Team Fantasy Football is a React application that allows users to select their favorite players for a number of positions and those selected players will be automatically added to their team. You can also create a name for your team and save both your team name and players saved to the saved teams page for future reference.
